This **Smart Attendance System** uses **AI** and **face recognition** integrated into a **web app** to automatically track and manage attendance in real-time, providing an accurate, fast, and contactless solution. The system integrates a **web application** that allows administrators to easily manage user profiles, attendance records, and reports. It detects and recognizes faces in real-time through live video streams or pre-recorded footage, marking attendance automatically as soon as an individual is identified. The system logs each attendance entry with a precise timestamp, offering a detailed history of attendance for each user. Built using technologies like **TensorFlow**, **OpenCV**, and **Python**, this system ensures accuracy and speed in identifying individuals, making it suitable for large groups in environments such as schools, offices, or events. It also respects privacy by securely processing user data. The web app provides a user-friendly interface for admins to monitor and export attendance logs, offering a seamless, efficient, and contactless attendance solution.
